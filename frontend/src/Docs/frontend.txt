Callback Request: For complex issues, users can request a scheduled phone consultation.

2. Administrative & Agent Dashboard
🎛️ Agent Workstation
Designed for maximum efficiency and clarity for individual support agents.

Smart Complaint Queue: An agent's default view is a queue of complaints assigned directly to them, automatically sorted by priority and age.

Priority Highlighting: Uses color-coding to flag Critical, Urgent, and SLA-Breaching tickets that require immediate attention.

360-Degree Customer View: Displays the full complaint details, PNR data, passenger history, and all tags applied by the rule engine (e.g., Premium_Train, Repeat_Issue, Weekend_Support).

Agent Toolkit:

Quick-action buttons for changing status or priority.

Canned response templates for common issues.

One-click escalation workflow with mandatory justification notes.

Ability to add internal notes (hidden from the customer) for collaboration.

📊 Supervisory & Departmental Dashboard
This is the command center for department heads and supervisors, providing both a high-level overview and granular control over their specific area of responsibility.

Department-Centric Filtering: The core feature is a powerful, hierarchical department selector. A supervisor can view complaints for:

An entire top-level department (e.g., selecting "Catering" shows all complaints from all its sub-units).

A specific sub-department (e.g., drilling down to "Catering > Premium Train Services").

Dynamic KPI Widgets: When a department is selected, all dashboard metrics instantly update to reflect that department's performance. This includes:

Department-Specific KPIs: Average Resolution Time, SLA Compliance %, Top 5 Complaint Categories within that department.

Performance Leaderboard: Ranks teams or agents within the selected department based on resolution time and volume.

Team Workload View: Provides a visual breakdown (e.g., bar chart) of open tickets assigned to each agent or sub-team within the department, allowing supervisors to easily spot imbalances and re-allocate resources.

Advanced Cross-Filtering: Supervisors can combine the department filter with other parameters for deep analysis, such as: "Show all 'High Priority' complaints in the 'Finance - Refunds' department that are older than 72 hours."

Saved Views and Scheduled Reports: Ability to save common filter sets (e.g., "My Department's Weekly Breached SLAs") and schedule automated email reports for senior management.

⚙️ Rules Engine Configuration Portal (Admin)
A powerful, no-code interface for managing the system's logic.

Visual Rule Builder: Allows authorized admins to create and modify rules using dropdowns and logical operators. An admin could build a rule like:

IF (complaint_text CONTAINS "TTE misbehaved") AND (PNR_data.train_type IN ["Rajdhani", "Vande_Bharat"])

THEN ASSIGN_TO "HR_Disciplinary_Premium" AND SET_PRIORITY "High" AND ADD_TAG "Staff_Behavior_Premium".

Rule Priority Management: Admins can set the execution order to ensure specific rules are evaluated before general ones.

A/B Testing: Framework to test the effectiveness of new rule variations on a percentage of live traffic.

Rule Performance Analytics: Dashboards showing how often each rule is triggered and its impact on resolution times.

🤖 Comprehensive Rule-Based Logic
The system's intelligence is derived from a multi-layered, deterministic rule set that processes complaints based on their content, context, and source.

1. Content & Context-Based Routing
The engine first analyzes the complaint text and any linked data to perform initial routing.

Keyword-Based Rules: Simple string matching for precise terms.

IF complaint_text CONTAINS "refund", "double charge" -> ASSIGN_TO: Finance_Refund_Team, SET_PRIORITY: High

IF complaint_text CONTAINS "unclean toilet", "dirty coach" -> ASSIGN_TO: Coaching_Maintenance_Team, SET_PRIORITY: Medium

PNR-Data-Based Rules: Leverages journey details for contextual assignment.

IF complaint_category IS "Catering" AND PNR_train_type IS "Vande_Bharat" -> ASSIGN_TO: Premium_Catering_Team, SET_PRIORITY: High

IF complaint_category IS "Station_Amenities" AND PNR_origin_zone IS "Northern_Railway" -> ASSIGN_TO: NR_Station_Management, ADD_TAG: Northern_Railway

Source-Based Rules: Differentiates based on how the complaint was submitted.

IF complaint_submitted_from "Emergency_Section" -> SET_PRIORITY: Critical, ASSIGN_TO: Emergency_Response_Team

IF user_login_type IS "Premium_Member" -> INCREASE_PRIORITY_BY_ONE_LEVEL, ASSIGN_TO: Premium_User_Support

2. Priority & SLA Management
The engine calculates and assigns priority levels which determine the required response times.

Critical Priority Rules: Triggered by severe safety or security issues.

IF complaint_text CONTAINS "medical emergency", "fire", "accident", "woman safety" -> SET_PRIORITY: Critical, TRIGGER_IMMEDIATE_ALERT: Senior_Management

High Priority Rules: For major service failures or financial issues.

IF complaint_text CONTAINS "payment_deducted_no_ticket", "tatkal booking failed" -> SET_PRIORITY: High

IF user_is_senior_citizen OR user_is_differently_abled -> INCREASE_PRIORITY_BY_ONE_LEVEL

SLA-Based Escalation Rules: The system monitors time elapsed and triggers actions.

IF complaint_priority IS "Critical" AND response_time > 30_minutes -> TRIGGER_ESCALATION_TO "Senior_Management"

IF complaint_category IS "Refund" AND days_since_cancellation > 15 -> FLAG_FOR "SLA_Breach_Review", ASSIGN_TO: Refund_Escalation_Team

3. Specialized & Fallback Logic
Ensures all complaints are handled, even unique or complex cases.

Multi-Factor Rules: Combines multiple conditions for highly specific routing.

IF (complaint_source IS "Social_Media" AND complaint_sentiment < -0.5) -> ASSIGN_TO: Public_Relations_Crisis_Team, SET_PRIORITY: Urgent

Pattern-Based Rules: Identifies repeat issues from a single user.

IF (user_previous_complaints > 2 AND complaint_category_matches_previous) -> ASSIGN_TO: Repeat_Issue_Resolution_Team, SET_PRIORITY: High

Default & Fallback Rules: A safety net for uncategorized complaints.

IF no_specific_rule_matches -> ASSIGN_TO "General_Grievance_Cell", FLAG_FOR "MANUAL_REVIEW"

IF PNR_data_unavailable AND complaint_category IS "Journey_Related" -> ASSIGN_TO: PNR_Verification_Team
